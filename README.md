# SigProc_Group6
This repository stores all the scripts developed by Group 6 in the Signal Processing Course CM2013 2025 offered by KTH.

By running the main.m file all phases will be executed using the data sets provided for the project.. This script is high in its computational demands.

By running the runML.m file the variables in the folder which were saved from previous iterations of the main.m file will be loaded into the workspace. This file runs different classifiers and evaluates the performance. It does not consider any feature selection algorithms, which was performed using the classification learner provided by MATLAB.
