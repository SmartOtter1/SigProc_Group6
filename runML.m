%% Phase 2
% This script only contains Feature Engineering Classification and
% evaluation of different classifiers.
% Preprocessing and feature extraction steps can be found in the runML.m
% script.

%% Variable explenation
% params: Structure to save all necessary settings for preprocessing and
% evaluating the signals. 
%
% numFiles: number of files which should be loaded
%
% allFeatures: Cell structure including all the saved features from the
% different files. Each cell represents one data file, each column in a
% cell represents one feature, and each row represents an epoch. 82
% features were extracted and saved -> each cell has 82 columns
% number of rows varies depending on the length of the signals from the
% file.
%
% allLabels: Cell structure including all saved labels representing the
% stage of each epoch. Each cell represnets one data file, including one
% column with the labels and m rows representing the number of epochs of
% the signal.
%
% fsIndex: Logical variable including the highest rated features for
% training the classifier according to a wrapped feature selection. 
%
% *Model: Cell structure storing the RF or KNN model settings for the
% different itterations. * = rf, knn
% 
% *Results: Structure including true labels and predicted labels for each
% iteration. Used to evaluate model performance. * = rf, knn
